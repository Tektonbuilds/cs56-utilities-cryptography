===========================

My assessment of the code
===============

Implementation of 3 different types of ciphers:
	       -Shift Cipher
	       -Affine Cipher
	       -Vigenere Cipher

-All the Ciphers  work well and it has good functionality.
-There are plenty of junit tests and all the ant targets make sense. 
-The Ciphers do seem pretty elementary and there could be a guide on the frame that pops up on how to enter in keys and plaintext.
-Perhaps change the shift cipher to a more complicated cipher and include hints on data entry?
