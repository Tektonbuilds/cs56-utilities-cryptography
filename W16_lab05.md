Project description: 
  This project involves methods that the encrypts strings using different ciphers such as shift or affine.

User stories: 
  As a student, I can encrypt my password so that my password is less vulnerable.
  As a user, I can chain different ciphers so that I can encrypt stored data in multiple layers.
  
Brief assessment: 
  Shift cipher: Shift cipher works when we tested it. It shifts the characters in a string by integer provided in the key. However, the shift cipher does not work with spaces.
  Affine cipher: Affine cipher works when we ran it through the terminal. The method takes two integers as keys where each integer is separated by a space and it multiplies each character's place in the alphabet by the first integer and shifts the characters of the new value by the second integer.
  Vigenere cipher: Vigenere cipher works when tested. It takes a string as a key and shifts each character of the plaintext by the key's characters. If the plaintext is shorter than the key, the shifting will only be up to the plaintext's length. If the key is shorter than the plaintext, the key will loop around and repeat itself e.g. abc will be abcabcabc for a long plaintext.
